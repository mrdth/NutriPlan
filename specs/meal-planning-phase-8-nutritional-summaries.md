# Meal Planning - Phase 8: Nutritional Summaries

## Overview
This phase will add the ability to view aggregated nutritional information across meal plans, helping users track their nutritional intake over days or weeks and make more informed dietary decisions.

## Core Functionality

### Nutritional Aggregation
- Calculation of daily nutritional totals from all recipes in the meal plan
- Weekly nutritional averages and summaries
- Visual representation of nutritional data (charts, graphs)
- Comparison against standard dietary guidelines

### Nutritional Insights
- Highlight nutritional strengths and potential deficiencies
- Track macronutrient ratios (carbs, protein, fat)
- Monitor micronutrients of interest
- Caloric distribution across meals and days

### Customization Options
- Set personal nutritional goals
- Highlight specific nutrients of interest
- Toggle between different visualization modes
- Exclude certain meals from calculations

## Important Note
**This phase is not yet ready for implementation and requires further planning and design.**

Additional considerations to address in detailed planning:
- Data visualization approach and library selection
- Handling recipes without complete nutritional information
- Algorithm for scaling nutritional data with recipe servings
- User interface for nutritional summary display
- Requirements for personalized nutritional targets

## Future Considerations
- Export of nutritional data to external tracking apps
- Integration with personal health monitoring
- Recommendations based on nutritional goals
- Historical tracking of nutritional patterns
- Smart substitution suggestions for nutritional optimization

*This specification will be expanded with implementation details prior to development.*
