# Meal Planning - Phase 7x: Barcode Scanning Integration

## Overview
This phase details the potential integration of barcode scanning functionality, allowing users to add items to their shopping list by scanning product barcodes using their mobile device.

This feature is considered an enhancement to the core shopping list functionality (Phase 7) and will be implemented separately.

## Core Functionality

### Barcode Scanning
- Utilize the mobile device's camera to scan standard product barcodes (e.g., UPC, EAN).
- Leverage the browser's built-in Barcode Detection API where available.
    - _Note:_ Check current browser compatibility: [MDN Barcode Detection API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Barcode_Detection_API#browser_compatibility)

### Barcode Lookup
- Integrate with a barcode lookup service to retrieve product information (name, potentially category) from a scanned barcode.
    - _Example Free API:_ [FreeWebAPI Barcode Lookup](https://freewebapi.com/data-apis/barcode-lookup-api/)
    - _Consideration:_ Reliability and rate limits of free APIs. May need a paid service for production.

### Shopping List Integration
- Provide an interface to add the identified product to the current or a selected shopping list.
- Allow users to specify quantity for the scanned item.
- Handle cases where a barcode is not found or the lookup fails.

## Technical Considerations
- **API Availability:** The Barcode Detection API is not universally supported across all mobile browsers. Need fallback or clear indication if the feature is unavailable.
- **Lookup Service:** The choice of barcode lookup API impacts cost, reliability, and data quality.
- **User Experience:** Scanning interface needs to be intuitive and handle camera permissions correctly.
- **Offline Support:** Consider if any level of offline scanning (e.g., storing codes to lookup later) is desired (likely a future enhancement).

## Future Considerations
- Integration with user inventory systems.
- Ability to scan store loyalty cards.
- Remembering previously scanned items.
- Suggesting recipes based on scanned items.

*This specification will require further detailed planning regarding API selection and UI design before implementation.*
