# Meal Planning - Phase 9: Cooking Notifications

## Overview
This phase will add a notification system to remind users about upcoming meals they need to prepare from their meal plans, helping them stay organized and ensuring they don't forget to prepare scheduled meals.

## Core Functionality

### Notification Types
- Day-before reminders for meals flagged "to cook"
- Morning reminders for meals to be cooked that day
- Custom timing options (e.g., notify X hours before planned cook time)
- Prep reminders for tasks that should be done ahead of time

### Notification Methods
- Browser/app push notifications
- Email notifications
- Optional SMS notifications
- In-app notification center

### Notification Content
- Recipe name and image
- Prep and cooking time required
- Any prep steps that should be done ahead (thawing, marinating, etc.)
- Direct link to the full recipe
- Quick action buttons (e.g., "Mark as complete", "Snooze")

### User Controls
- Global on/off toggle for notifications
- Per-meal plan notification settings
- Preferred notification times and lead times
- Notification frequency preferences
- Category-based notification filters

## Important Note
**This phase is not yet ready for implementation and requires further planning and design.**

Additional considerations to address in detailed planning:
- Backend notification scheduling architecture
- User preference schema and storage
- Integration with browser notification APIs
- Email and SMS delivery services
- Handling of time zones for accurate notification delivery
- Managing notification permissions

## Future Considerations
- Smart scheduling based on user behavior patterns
- Aggregated notifications to prevent overwhelming the user
- Integration with calendar apps
- Voice assistant integration for hands-free cooking guidance
- Integration with smart home devices for cooking reminders

*This specification will be expanded with implementation details prior to development.*
