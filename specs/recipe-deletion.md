Recipe Deletion Feature Plan
1. Backend Components
    - Controller Method
        - Add a destroy method to the RecipeController if it doesn't already exist
        - The method should:
            - Verify user authorization (only recipe creator can delete)
            - Delete the recipe
            - Return appropriate response
    - Action Class
        - Create a DeleteRecipeAction class in app/Actions
        - This action will handle the actual deletion logic
        - Should handle related records (like nutrition information)
    - Policy Update
        - Update or create RecipePolicy to include a delete method
        - Ensure only the recipe creator can delete their recipes
2. Frontend Components
    - Edit Page Modification
        - Add a delete button to the recipe edit form
        - Position it separately from other actions (to avoid accidental clicks)
        - Style it with a warning/danger color
    - Confirmation Modal
        - Create a confirmation modal component or use an existing one
        - Include clear warning text about permanent deletion
        - Provide cancel and confirm buttons
    - API Integration
        - Add a delete method to recipe service/API client
        - Handle success and error responses
        - Redirect to recipes index page after successful deletion
3. Testing
    - Controller Tests
        - Add tests in tests/Feature/Http/Controllers/RecipeControllerTest.php
        - Test authorization (can delete own recipes, cannot delete others')
        - Test successful deletion
        - Test error handling
    - Action Tests
        - Create tests in tests/Unit/Actions/DeleteRecipeActionTest.php
        - Test successful deletion including related records
        - Test error handling
    - Policy Tests
        - Test policy in tests/Unit/Policies/RecipePolicyTest.php
        - Verify authorization logic works correctly
    - Frontend Tests
        - Add component tests for the delete button and confirmation modal
        - Test API integration
