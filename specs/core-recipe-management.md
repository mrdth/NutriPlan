# Core Recipe Management

## Overview
The Core Recipe Management feature provides essential CRUD functionality for recipes, allowing users to create, view, edit, and list recipes. This feature serves as the foundation of the entire NutriPlan application, enabling users to manage their culinary content effectively.

  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Cooking and preparation times
  - Servings
  - Categories
- Form validation to ensure all required fields are completed
- Preview functionality before final submission

### Recipe Viewing
- Detailed recipe view displaying all recipe information
- Clean, readable layout optimized for cooking usage
- Visual indicators for cooking and preparation times
