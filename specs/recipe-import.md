# Recipe Import & Enhancement

## Overview
The Recipe Import & Enhancement feature enables users to import recipes from external websites while automatically parsing and structuring the data. The system extracts key recipe information including categories, ingredients, and nutritional data, creating a complete recipe entry without manual data entry.

## User Story
As a user, I want to easily import recipes from websites I visit, so that I can quickly build my recipe collection without having to manually enter all the details.

## Functional Requirements

### Recipe Import
- Import recipes via URL input
- Automatic extraction of recipe structured data (schema.org)
- Support for major recipe websites and blogs
- Progress indication during import process
- Error handling for unsupported or malformed websites

### Category Parsing
- Automatic extraction of recipe categories from imported content
- Mapping of external categories to internal category system
- Creation of new categories when necessary
- Intelligent handling of category variations and synonyms

### Ingredient Parsing
- Smart parsing of ingredient strings into structured data
- Extraction of:
  - Ingredient name
  - Amount
  - Unit of measurement
- Handling of fractional measurements and ranges
- Matching with existing ingredients in the database
- Creation of new ingredients when necessary

### Nutrition Information
- Extraction of nutritional data when available
- Support for common nutritional metrics:
  - Calories
  - Protein
  - Carbohydrates
  - Fat
  - Fiber
  - Sodium
- Storage of nutritional information per recipe
- Option to manually adjust extracted values

### Reimport Capability
- Ability to update existing imported recipes
- Command-line interface for batch reimporting
- Preservation of user modifications during reimport

## Technical Specifications

### Backend Implementation
- RecipeParser service for structured data extraction
- IngredientParser service for ingredient string processing
- NutritionParser service for nutritional data handling
- Artisan command for recipe reimporting

### Frontend Components
- Recipe import form with URL input
- Import progress indicator
- Error handling and user feedback

### External Dependencies
- Schema.org structured data parser
- HTTP client for fetching external content

## Security Considerations
- Sanitization of imported content to prevent XSS
- Rate limiting for import requests
- Validation of external URLs

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for parser services
- Feature tests for import functionality
- Edge case handling for various website formats

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can successfully import recipes from supported websites
2. Imported recipes contain accurate title, description, ingredients, and instructions
3. Categories are correctly extracted and mapped
4. Ingredients are parsed into name, amount, and unit components
5. Nutritional information is extracted when available
6. Import errors are handled gracefully with user feedback

## Implementation Notes
- Use structured data (JSON-LD, microdata) as primary source
- Implement fallback parsing for sites without proper structured data
- Ensure proper attribution for imported recipes
