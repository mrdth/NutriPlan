# Meal Planning Feature

## Overview
The Meal Planning feature will allow users to create weekly or bi-weekly meal plans, add recipes to specific days, and organize their cooking schedule. The system will help users manage portions and servings based on the number of people they're cooking for.

## Phased Implementation

To deliver value incrementally and manage development complexity, the Meal Planning feature will be implemented in phases:

### Initial Implementation Phases

1. **[Phase 1: Basic Meal Plans](meal-planning-phase-1-basic-meal-plans.md)**
   - Create and manage empty meal plans with basic metadata

2. **[Phase 2: Recipe Assignment](meal-planning-phase-2-recipe-assignment.md)**
   - Add recipes to meal plans and manage servings

3. **[Phase 3: Day Organization](meal-planning-phase-3-day-organization.md)**
   - Assign recipes to specific days within the plan

4. **[Phase 4: Drag and Drop + "To Cook" Flags](meal-planning-phase-4-drag-and-drop.md)**
   - Implement drag-and-drop interface and cooking flags

5. **[Phase 5: Plan Copying](meal-planning-phase-5-plan-copying.md)**
   - Enable copying existing plans to create new ones

6. **[Phase 6: Mobile Optimization](meal-planning-phase-6-mobile-optimization.md)**
   - Fully optimize the experience for mobile devices

### Future Enhancement Phases

The following phases will be developed later and require additional planning:

7. **[Phase 7: Shopping List Integration](meal-planning-phase-7-shopping-list-integration.md)**
   - Automatically generate shopping lists from meal plans

8. **[Phase 8: Nutritional Summaries](meal-planning-phase-8-nutritional-summaries.md)**
   - Show nutritional totals per day or week

9. **[Phase 9: Cooking Notifications](meal-planning-phase-9-cooking-notifications.md)**
   - Reminders for meals flagged "to cook"

Each phase builds upon the previous one, delivering incremental value to users while managing development complexity.
