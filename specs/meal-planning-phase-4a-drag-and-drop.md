# Meal Planning - Phase 4a: Drag and Drop Interface

## Overview
This phase enhances the meal planning interface by implementing a drag-and-drop system for meal assignment organization.

## Core Functionality

### Drag and Drop Interface
- Users can drag meal assignments between days in the meal plan
- Visual cues indicate valid drop zones during drag operations
- Smooth animations provide feedback during drag and drop
- Implementation works for both desktop and mobile interfaces

### Enhanced Calendar View
- More sophisticated calendar-style interface
- Improved visual design for day containers
- Better spacing and organization of meal assignments within days
- Meal assignment cards with enhanced information display (recipe name, serving count)

## Implementation Details

### Backend Requirements
- API endpoints for drag-and-drop operations (moving meal assignments between days and updating their order)

### Frontend Requirements
- Drag-and-drop library integration (e.g., vue-draggable or similar)
- Visual indicators for drag handles and valid drop zones during interactions
- Refined calendar layout with improved spacing and organization
- Accessibility considerations for drag and drop (e.g., keyboard controls)

## Mobile Considerations
- Touch-based drag and drop implementation
- Larger drag handles for mobile interfaces
- "Long press" gesture to initiate drag on touch devices
- Haptic feedback during drag operations (where supported)

## Testing Criteria
- Drag and drop operations for meal assignments work correctly across devices (desktop and mobile)
- Meal assignments correctly update their associated day and potentially order after being dropped
- Enhanced calendar view renders correctly on various screen sizes
- Accessibility requirements are met for drag and drop interactions

## Value Proposition
This phase significantly improves the user experience of meal planning by making meal assignment organization more intuitive and flexible through drag and drop.
