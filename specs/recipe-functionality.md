# Recipe Functionality

## Overview
The Recipe Functionality feature enhances the core recipe experience with practical tools for cooking, including recipe scaling, flexible ingredient management, and support for optional measurement units. These features make recipes more adaptable to users' specific needs and cooking situations.

## User Story
As a home cook, I want to easily adjust recipe quantities, manage ingredients flexibly, and handle various measurement formats, so that I can adapt recipes to my specific needs and cooking style.

## Functional Requirements

### Recipe Scaling
- Ability to scale recipe quantities up or down
- Interactive serving size adjuster with preset multipliers (0.5x, 2x, 3x, etc.)
- Real-time calculation of scaled ingredient amounts
- Preservation of original recipe while displaying scaled version
- Handling of edge cases (very small or large amounts)

### Ingredient Management
- On-the-fly creation of new ingredients during recipe creation/editing
- Ingredient search with autocomplete
- Ingredient suggestion based on partial matches
- Comprehensive ingredient database with common cooking ingredients
- Categorization of ingredients (produce, dairy, meat, etc.)

### Optional Ingredient Units
- Support for ingredients without specified units (e.g., "2 eggs" vs "100g flour")
- Flexible parsing of unitless ingredients
- Ability to add/remove units from existing ingredients
- Consistent display of ingredients with and without units
- Conversion support for ingredients with optional units

## Technical Specifications

### Backend Implementation
- Scaling algorithms for accurate quantity calculations
- Ingredient service for managing ingredient data
- Unit conversion system for common cooking measurements

### Frontend Components
- Interactive serving size adjuster
- Ingredient input with real-time suggestions
- Unit toggle component for ingredient forms

### Database Structure
- Flexible ingredient-recipe relationship supporting optional units
- Data validation for ingredients with and without units

## Security Considerations
- Validation of user-created ingredients
- Prevention of calculation errors in scaling
- Protection against injection attacks in ingredient creation

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for scaling algorithms
- Feature tests for ingredient creation flow
- Edge case testing for various measurement scenarios
- User acceptance testing for scaling interface

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can successfully scale recipes with accurate ingredient calculations
2. Users can create new ingredients while adding them to recipes
3. Ingredients can be specified with or without units as appropriate
4. UI clearly indicates original vs scaled quantities
5. Ingredients are consistently displayed regardless of unit presence
6. Scaling handles edge cases appropriately

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure mobile-friendly interface for scaling controls
- Consider internationalization aspects for units and measurements
- Use proper rounding rules for scaled quantities
