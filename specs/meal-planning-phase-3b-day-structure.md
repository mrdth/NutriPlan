# Meal Planning - Phase 3b: Day Structure

## Overview
This phase builds upon the meal tracking functionality by introducing the concept of days within a meal plan, allowing for day-based organization and visualization.

## Core Functionality

### Day-Based Structure
- Each meal plan has days automatically generated based on its duration
- Each day shows its name and date calculated from the plan start date
- Days are displayed in a calendar-style layout on the meal plan detail page

## Database Structure

### MealPlanDay Model (New)
- MealPlan relationship (foreign key)
- Day number (integer, representing day number from plan start date)
- Timestamps for creation/update

## Implementation Details

### Backend Requirements
- Migration for new table (meal_plan_days)
- MealPlanDay model creation
- Controller methods to generate days when meal plans are created
- API routes to retrieve day information

### Frontend Requirements
- Simple calendar-style layout for meal plan detail page
- Day headers with dates calculated from plan start date
- Visual representation of each day as a container for future meal assignments
- Empty state UI for days with no meals assigned

## Testing Criteria
- Days are correctly generated based on meal plan duration
- Day dates are calculated correctly from the plan start date
- UI displays days in a clear, organized manner
- All previous functionality continues to work

## Value Proposition
This phase establishes the day-based structure that transforms meal plans from simple recipe collections into practical daily meal schedules. By organizing the meal plan into discrete days, users gain a clearer visualization of their meal planning timeline, setting the stage for meal assignments in the next phase.
