# Collections & Categories

## Overview
The Collections & Categories feature allows users to organize their recipes through two complementary systems: categories for tagging recipes with specific attributes, and collections for grouping recipes into custom sets. This provides flexible organization options and enhances recipe discovery.

## User Story
As a user, I want to categorize my recipes and create custom collections, so that I can easily find specific types of recipes and organize them in meaningful ways.

## Functional Requirements

### Recipe Categories
- System for tagging recipes with predefined and custom categories
- Management interface for creating, editing, and deleting categories
- Bulk association of categories to recipes
- Category activation/deactivation without deletion

### Category Visualization
- Visual representation of categories on recipe cards and detail pages
- Category tags with appropriate styling
- Category filtering in recipe lists
- Category-based navigation

### Category Filtering
- Filter recipe list by one or multiple categories
- Intuitive UI for selecting category filters
- Clear visual indication of active filters
- Easy filter removal/reset
- Filter combinations with AND/OR logic

### Collections Feature
- Creation of named recipe collections (e.g., "Weeknight Dinners", "Holiday Menu")
- Adding/removing recipes to/from collections
- Collection management interface
- Visual representation of collections
- Collection-based navigation

## Technical Specifications

### Database Structure
- Category model with many-to-many relationship to recipes
- Collection model with many-to-many relationship to recipes
- Proper indexing for optimized filtering queries

### Backend Implementation
- RESTful controllers for categories and collections
- Efficient query optimization for filtered results
- Proper validation and authorization

### Frontend Components
- Category tag components
- Category filter interface
- Collection management interface
- Collection and category badges on recipe cards

## Security Considerations
- Authorization checks for category and collection management
- Prevention of category name conflicts
- Validation of category and collection names

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for category and collection models
- Feature tests for category filtering
- Feature tests for collection management
- Frontend component tests

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can create, edit, and manage categories
2. Users can assign categories to recipes
3. Users can filter recipes by one or more categories
4. Users can create and manage personal recipe collections
5. Users can add and remove recipes from collections
6. Categories and collections are visually represented in the UI

## Implementation Notes
- Keep category system simple and intuitive
- Ensure responsive design for collection and category interfaces
- Optimize database queries for category filtering
