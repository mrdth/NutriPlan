# Laravel Frontend Rules

## Icons
- Use Lucide icons exclusively throughout the application
- Import icons from `lucide-vue-next` package
- Use PascalCase for icon component names (e.g., `Heart`, `Settings`, `Menu`)
- For filled variants, use the `-fill` suffix (e.g., `HeartFill`)
- Maintain consistent icon sizing across the application
- Ensure icons are properly aligned with text and other elements
