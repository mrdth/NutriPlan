# MDC Rules Location Rule

This rule specifies that all new MDC (Model-Driven Code) rules should be created in the `.cursor/rules` directory.

## Rule Details

- **Name**: MDC Rules Location
- **Type**: Directory Structure
- **Scope**: Project-wide
- **Priority**: High

## Requirements

1. All new MDC rules must be created in the `.cursor/rules` directory
2. Each rule should be in a separate file
3. Rule files should use the `.mdc` extension
4. Rule files should follow the naming convention: `[rule_name].mdc`

## Implementation

When creating new MDC rules:
1. Create the rule file in `.cursor/rules/`
2. Use descriptive filenames that reflect the rule's purpose
3. Include proper documentation within each rule file
4. Follow the standard MDC rule format

## Example

```mdc
# Example Rule File Structure
.cursor/rules/
  ├── mdc_rules_location.mdc
  ├── naming_conventions.mdc
  └── code_style.mdc
```

## Validation

The IDE will enforce this rule by:
1. Only allowing MDC rule creation in the specified directory
2. Validating file extensions
3. Ensuring proper file naming conventions
