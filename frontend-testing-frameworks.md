# Vue Testing Framework Recommendations for NutriPlan

## Primary Recommendation: Vitest + Vue Test Utils

**Vitest** would be my top recommendation for your project because:

1. **Vue Ecosystem Compatibility**: It's designed specifically for Vue and Vite projects (which you're using)
2. **Modern & Fast**: It's significantly faster than Jest and built on top of Vite
3. **Vue Test Utils Integration**: Works perfectly with Vue Test Utils, the official testing utility library for Vue
4. **TypeScript Support**: Native TypeScript support (which you're using in your Vue components)
5. **Familiar API**: Jest-compatible API, making migration easy if you've used Jest before

## Additional Tools to Consider

1. **Testing Library**: For more user-centric testing approaches
   - `@testing-library/vue` provides a more user-focused testing experience

2. **Cypress Component Testing**: For component testing with real browser rendering
   - Great for testing complex UI interactions and visual regressions

3. **Storybook**: Not a testing framework per se, but excellent for component development and visual testing
   - Can integrate with other testing tools for visual regression testing

## Implementation Strategy

I'd recommend starting with:

1. Vitest + Vue Test Utils for unit and component tests
2. Consider adding Cypress for E2E tests if needed

This approach would align well with your existing Pest PHP testing on the backend while providing a modern, efficient testing solution for your Vue components.
